    <h2> As told by Emily</h2>

    <p> I never thought I was going to be married. I was always so focused on my career as a travel writer and putting my all into it. Iâ€™ve met people all over the world, so little did I know that the man I was going to marry was from my small town in Utah. </p>

    <p>I had just gotten back into town after returning from a month-long trip to Spain. My mother had planned a day for us to hit all our local shops and grab a bite to eat. Jet-lagged and beyond exhausted, I was very close to calling my mother and cancelling on our plans. I decided to push through and join her for our day. One of our first stops was to a local antique shop. When I walked in, it was love at first sight. This antique couch was the perfect thing for my living room. During my transaction with the store owner, I joked that I hoped I would be able to move this all by myself. He laughed and then offered the services of his son who was around my age. I politely accepted and went on with my day. The next morning, I hear a knock on my door. It was you. The interaction was so easy and effortless. You were funny, handsome, charming, and had the best smile. On your way out, you turned around and asked me out. It caught me off guard but I took a chance and said yes. Today, I am writing this in our home that we purchased together, on the couch that he helped deliver.   </p>
