    <h1> Our Story</h1>

    <p class="date"> <time datetime="2021-11-28">November 28, 2021</time></p>

    <h2> As told by Emily</h2>
    <p> It was July 4th weekend, and my mother and I were hitting some antique stores in a nearby town before my family headed to the lake for the holiday. </p>
    <p>I wanted to check out one shop in particular that had great original art and antiques. </p>
    <p>A few minutes into our visit, we were in a light-hearted conversation with the owner about where we were from, but our chat was interrupted when someone came in to buy a bottle of furniture polish. </p>
    <p>Based on the amount of conversation I overheard, he obviously knew the owner.</p>
    <p>To my embarrassment, when he left, my mother asked the store owner if the guy was single and close to my age. </p>
    <p>(I blew this off as her trying to make me blush before we headed off for lunch.)</p>

    <p>I did not think about the interaction again until the Monday after the holiday.</p>
    <p>Mid-morning, I received a call on my cell phone from the owner of the store that we had visited the week before. </p>
    <p>I quickly began retracing my steps to think if I had left a credit card or something in the shop, but he explained that he had attended a Fourth of July cookout that weekend and Scott, the man who bought the furniture polish, had also attended.</p>
    <p>In small-town North Carolina fashion, the store owner had called around town asking people for my number, because apparently I had caught Scottâ€™s attention, and the store owner wanted to know if he could pass my number along to him.</p>
    <p> He continued to say that he had a good track record of setting up couples and reminded me that my mother had also mentioned Scott in the store. </p>
    <p>I was shocked and frankly, speechless. </p>
    <p>The whole thing seemed bizarre, but I took a chance and said yes. </p>
    <p>Two days later I received a phone call. </p>
    <p>A week later we went on our first date. </p>
    <p>Three years later we were married in my hometown. </p>
    <p>The owner of the shop attended the wedding, and he and my mother take full credit for our relationship.</p>
