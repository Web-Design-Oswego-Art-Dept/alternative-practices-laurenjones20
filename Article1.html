    <h2> As told by Emily</h2>

    <p> It was July 4th weekend, and my mother and I were hitting some antique stores in a nearby town before my family headed to the lake for the holiday. I wanted to check out one shop in particular that had great original art and antiques. A few minutes into our visit, we were in a light-hearted conversation with the owner about where we were from, but our chat was interrupted when someone came in to buy a bottle of furniture polish. Based on the amount of conversation I overheard, he obviously knew the owner. To my embarrassment, when he left, my mother asked the store owner if the guy was single and close to my age. (I blew this off as her trying to make me blush before we headed off for lunch.)</p>

    <p>I did not think about the interaction again until the Monday after the holiday. Mid-morning, I received a call on my cell phone from the owner of the store that we had visited the week before. I quickly began retracing my steps to think if I had left a credit card or something in the shop, but he explained that he had attended a Fourth of July cookout that weekend and Scott, the man who bought the furniture polish, had also attended. In small-town North Carolina fashion, the store owner had called around town asking people for my number, because apparently I had caught Scott’s attention, and the store owner wanted to know if he could pass my number along to him. He continued to say that he had a good track record of setting up couples and reminded me that my mother had also mentioned Scott in the store. I was shocked and frankly, speechless. The whole thing seemed bizarre, but I took a chance and said yes. Two days later I received a phone call. A week later we went on our first date. Three years later we were married in my hometown. The owner of the shop attended the wedding, and he and my mother take full credit for our relationship.</p>
